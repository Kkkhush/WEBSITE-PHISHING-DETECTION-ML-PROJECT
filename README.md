This project aimed to enhance the understanding of cyber-attacks, specifically phishing, by improving the accuracy of detection using various machine learning models. The primary challenge addressed in this study was the identification of phishing websites based on their URLs, which cyber criminals commonly use to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials and banking details.
